# BRCDataDashboard
Experimental Dashboard for Data

This was the first attempt at building a shiny dashboard for all of the data (related to retail and consumer spending) held by the Insight & Analytics team at the BRC. This project was later developed further, but using my company github account: BRC-RML. The project can be found here:

Note that in the initial stages as we were using locally held excel for all data (rather than reading APIs), and some of this data was propietory it could not be posted here.
